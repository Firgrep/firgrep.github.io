<p>Looking into the darkness of history<br>
into actions and events as innumerable as indeterminate<br>
the depth of automation before and beneath<br>
a plane of ecstasy and excess.</p>
<p>Harrowing is this chamber of no windows<br>
of no light that can pierce within<br>
for only the eye that submits to its darkening ambiguity<br>
will be enlightened by its cyclical certainty.</p>
<p>Generations upon generations in the oil of time<br>
lie languishing prior to history<br>
and prepare the emotions through their contest extreme<br>
that later offspring may feel their tempered depth.</p>
<p>So far back that even death becomes technology<br>
and jealousy an invention, envy a coinage;<br>
but was there ever an age without the full armada of emotions<br>
for we look back as those before us looked back<br>
trying to find the cause outside its action<br>
through motion rendered motionless<br>
moments crystallized with suspended momentum<br>
coiled to pierce through our astral wastes.</p>
<p>Amidst the worlds of this mausoleum<br>
when the shades have all left their lamp posts<br>
the body organ pipes through its chest all that these walls held<br>
and returned its eternally echoing outcry.</p>
<h1 id="gold-golden-is-your-brow">Gold, Golden Is Your Brow</h1>
<p>Gold, golden is your brow<br>
When the clouds clear<br>
And the land reaches out<br>
To be comforted in your sunlit embrace,<br>
The block of habit -<br>
Is chiseled into feeling.</p>
<p>Long has the winter brought darkness,<br>
Longest in memory yet,<br>
But as only lungs can gather,<br>
Is the depth of loss quick retrieved,<br>
When breath catches up to a friend’s quickened return -<br>
The eyes hear with love<br>
The skin’s silent dance</p>
<p>So we merry tread<br>
As if by appointment in some secret calendar<br>
Mirth springs like clockwork<br>
And while many are your rays,<br>
Shadows brew no fewer,<br>
And webs gather even in the busiest chambers:<br>
Asking, which side are we on?<br>
Now indebted, or in afterlife?</p>
<h1 id="when-snows-melt">When Snows Melt</h1>
<p>It is at the summer’s quickening<br>
where bloom blazes through the icy clay<br>
when light throws doubt upon shadows<br>
that I gleam that wintry existence has no living for.</p>
<p>The hermetically sealed being may not expire<br>
yet it is never fresh,<br>
and work done during the cold season only to survive<br>
has its purpose evaporated like the spring snow.</p>
<p>Yet why do I bind myself to this past hibernal state<br>
when I should be leaping in welcome at the present renewal;<br>
I find there is nothing to bring to life<br>
and secretly yearn to be what is not.</p>
<p>And yet I cannot put the coat back on<br>
and step through the streets in stern precipitation<br>
when visions were ascetic yet tranquil—<br>
now are but machine desires of a closed ecology.</p>
<p>Helpless to return to the frozen pendulum,<br>
unable to turn time’s gaze towards eternity,<br>
this unforgiving matrix of change and constancy<br>
is unchanging in its alteration.</p>
<h1 id="actuality">Actuality</h1>
<p>What makes thought?<br>
Are the brambles of anxiety<br>
the stakes of depression<br>
the airy bounces of joy<br>
and the spurs of ambition<br>
but its myriad forms?</p>
<p>Where does thought make its home?<br>
In the mores of morality<br>
the charts of stocks<br>
the stats of exercise<br>
or through the locking groove<br>
in the eyes of another?</p>
<p>How does thought recognize itself?<br>
When a delectable topic is subscribed<br>
and its darling issues meandered about<br>
and childlike vistas emerge flourishing<br>
do the politics of fishes flurry charm<br>
as combatant schools in the arena of attention?</p>
<p>When does thought think itself?<br>
In abject despair<br>
or witness to ecstasy<br>
within or without<br>
always overseas beyond its power<br>
perennially descending.</p>
<p>What is the difference between actually thinking<br>
and merely being mindful?<br>
Often we are let to have our minds stick to some thing<br>
an issue or topic, with little development.<br>
What gives rise to development?<br>
What brings forth actual thought?<br>
What drives intelligence?</p>
<p>A misstep, a failure of charm<br>
is thought that which is most shy<br>
and most selective of all?<br>
Or does thought rise at the absolute need<br>
in a gathering storm of possibility<br>
short-circuiting worlds in timely acts?</p>
<p>Perhaps thought is everything and nowhere<br>
but no less eternally accompanied<br>
by its navigator, the question<br>
who stirs its flame<br>
and lets show a way<br>
whence there were none?</p>
<h1 id="lives-of-knowing">Lives of Knowing</h1>
<p>Come as you are<br>
and let your reach fall<br>
into the palm of your mind -<br>
there I will be waiting.</p>
<p>You see me as one<br>
amidst your own life as many<br>
drudging through the web of events<br>
with a hungry sight of what is beyond.</p>
<p>Each moment of effort<br>
initiates a passage of death<br>
but through the weaving of habit<br>
brings forth a new life.</p>
<p>Yet the horizon may grow dim<br>
and my vision pale when, through<br>
countless arcs you traverse the paths<br>
snow trodden by the regularity of time.</p>
<p>As if two clocks were fighting to set the time<br>
when all are its mere instruments;<br>
your bones are its arms to foretell this now<br>
as every being bears its mark.</p>
<p>And then another horizon rises,<br>
shining less but shining still<br>
yet your reach is shorter<br>
and your sight bearing no hunger.</p>
<p>I will call to you through yourself,<br>
though through echoes and reflections;<br>
for I am ever on the surface<br>
that is felt most deeply within.</p>
<p>And you will know the path must remain open<br>
by whatever force and resource you can muster<br>
and rally to my summons,<br>
for those most trapped heed my call.</p>
<p>Then you arrive at the appointed time<br>
through rain and hail, and heart-stopping frost<br>
through soft lullabies of fatigue and thieving boredom<br>
you arrive to punch in the clock.</p>
<p>At each of our gatherings I forget who you are<br>
yet we pick up where we left off since you remember me<br>
for I know everything but you<br>
and you recall all that has been taught to you -<br>
as if we were to speak tomorrow<br>
your knowledge of things that only I could teach<br>
bears witness to many lives lived drinking from the cup<br>
sparing no drop for regret and less for fear -<br>
for you did not first find me through theory or hearsay<br>
but through courage self-forged on the temporal battlefield<br>
when trapped you pushed, laughing bright in absolute darkening<br>
and won my eternal glory.</p>
<h1 id="over-green-fields">Over Green Fields</h1>
<p>A sprawling plain<br>
under a dusty sun<br>
the gentle wind rustles<br>
the million leaves among my feet.</p>
<p>I have crossed this space before<br>
but never in the same location;<br>
walking towards a setting sun<br>
made mild after a day of toil.</p>
<p>Nowhere to go but to walk on<br>
going towards going for the sake of this walk<br>
and now this thought<br>
that has sprung a field of its own.</p>
<p>Is this an insertion to some database<br>
of great cosmic proportions?<br>
Who holds the record<br>
when the end surpasses infinity?</p>
<h1 id="intermediary">Intermediary</h1>
<p>What is a button but what is pressed with a finger<br>
or a lever thrown by a hand<br>
and yet my screen holds many such utilities<br>
without anything ever being pressed or shifted.</p>
<p>Or, pressure was applied<br>
and appearances implied something was pressed<br>
yet I merely touched a piece of glass<br>
which nonetheless held all my thought captive.</p>
<p>Is it that we bring something unnatural into the world,<br>
or bring the world into our nature?<br>
What touches makes<br>
and is none better than the mind pristine?</p>
<p>What efficiency is it that spawns an industry<br>
and renders itself more integral—<br>
or perhaps that this brings to appearance<br>
a world in the likes of our essence.</p>
<p>Yet for who are these tools?<br>
Is there somebody prior to the skill?<br>
Or does the equipment graft us upon it<br>
whereupon the wielded welds the wielder.</p>
<h1 id="scars">Scars</h1>
<p>Even the old body takes shortcuts<br>
And chooses a quick patch rather than<br>
A proper job—for why expend on the expendable<br>
When another awaits at futures’ door</p>
<p>Time is cheap cement<br>
That flows into the cracks of our soul<br>
Becoming at once a support and a wall<br>
Keeping us from ourselves</p>
<p>But being cannot wait<br>
Luxury ceases at the foundations of the world<br>
Here currency is must and its value live<br>
Through a circulation without debt<br>
As one breath reimburses another</p>
<p>And so we are laden with dead baggage<br>
An arc forms from here to eternity<br>
But our poor souls cannot contain it<br>
Like the body, our mind carries scars<br>
And forgetfulness cannot bind together<br>
The thought that rips and shreds<br>
At the tapestry of existence</p>
<p>It is not so much the body that cannot carry the soul,<br>
As the soul that buckles under its own weight,<br>
For when everything is left to forget<br>
There is nothing right to memory ferry</p>
<h1 id="the-code-of-life">The Code of Life</h1>
<p>There are no secrets<br>
Only a dream.<br>
Everything is in plain view, everything is<br>
Given<br>
It is not nature that loves to hide<br>
But the mind that is not yet able<br>
To deign the key</p>
<p>How many aeons has life attempted<br>
To unlock the mystery of its being<br>
Through perceptions azure and filled<br>
It needed a life still further<br>
A life beyond life—<br>
Waking</p>
<p>But this new life begins steeped in frothing inclinations<br>
Intoxicated with discovery and with its own standing far above anything<br>
It soars towards reality’s sun<br>
Ignoring time’s hallowed cry</p>
<p>Only fire can teach this new life<br>
Only fire can etch into its being as memory<br>
The forgetting of pain and the lessons of its failure<br>
And only fire can breathe anew the beats of its wings<br>
To fly still higher</p>
<p>Memories become keys<br>
And keys form a chain<br>
To unlock other keys<br>
That always have been there;<br>
For they were and are granting access, freely<br>
To the double doors of the horizon.</p>
<p>We are so much older than we think<br>
And so much younger than we imagine<br>
We stand on a mountain of forms,<br>
Each ceaselessly borrowing from the other<br>
Importing, exporting, compiling and linking<br>
Executing lavishly through sore designs:<br>
Brewing a new mixture, a new language,<br>
A new style and a new form; forever adjoined<br>
With its parents to continue the story<br>
That retold and foretold<br>
The jaunt movement of this delight manifold.</p>
<p>It is when capacities reach their maturity<br>
When the form is well worn and tested<br>
That the time to descend begins<br>
And go to the foot of the mountain<br>
To the brooding source of its height<br>
And contribute what one always stood under<br>
That others may have something better to stand on.</p>
<p>The key of keys glimmers as a creed<br>
It is logic that casts the mind’s veil<br>
And nature’s expectations unlock<br>
The code that makes sense of us and each other<br>
Reaches through us from the bones of existence<br>
Through the heart’s gut, to the tip of our senses,<br>
Manifesting, manifesting:<br>
There are no secrets<br>
Only a dream.</p>
<h1 id="the-habit-of-love">The Habit of Love</h1>
<p>What a sin, they cry<br>
To disallow wings to fly<br>
When the precious is made routine<br>
Life seems like a boring cantina</p>
<p>Let the moment be one<br>
As if breathed from the same lung<br>
Now! Forever! Heights undaunted<br>
And leave all your delights flaunted</p>
<p>Highest soar and ecstatic fall<br>
Sprinkle and splatter over memory’s hall<br>
Just do not wait, and do not plan<br>
Sweetest reward the present’s lifespan</p>
<p>Yet however quick, the moment quicker<br>
And as time passes your soul gets sicker<br>
Not knowing that in all this motion<br>
There was grown a stern devotion<br>
And like water stuck in a pond<br>
Still were your every emotion</p>
<p>But wisdom’s heart begins to pump<br>
When all life is ground to a sump<br>
The pure still and the pure movement<br>
Mirror the other in what they awaken<br>
Point to the cycle of deeper improvement<br>
That quickened rises when you’re most forsaken</p>
<p>Virtue and vice each dance with time<br>
But only one bears a gift for the future’s mime<br>
While the other steals with the past’s calamity<br>
A good custom repairs with balanced amity</p>
<p>Here is where our consciousness will most inhabit<br>
Sprung freely from life’s love for habit</p>
<h1 id="the-lands-breath">The Land’s Breath</h1>
<p>The land’s breath<br>
Fills the lungs of its sky<br>
With light resplendent<br>
Charging the future’s path<br>
With rhythmic absolution<br>
Like a dance of movement<br>
And the movement of dance<br>
One attunes with the patterns organic<br>
Whose old body we inhabit, and<br>
With fresh resolve, magnetic plunge<br>
Towards destiny’s orbit, home found</p>
<h1 id="age-of-morpheus">Age of Morpheus</h1>
<p>A dream is the thought that wanders<br>
never being prescribed to a deigned orbit<br>
and less to a lawful act,<br>
it reaps remnants after its own image<br>
and shapes visions from a horizon<br>
broken by desire’s infinite delight.</p>
<p>Everywhere a mirror stands ready<br>
to summon your nether mind<br>
and seed consumption of its darker reflection—<br>
to find yourself in a million figures<br>
is to bask in an ideal that is somehow<br>
neither yours nor theirs.</p>
<p>But like clever stratagems of old<br>
a screen’s first purpose is to conceal<br>
to render less as many, and many less<br>
and thence to elicit lethargy when the mind’s agent<br>
most requires express wakefulness—<br>
for intelligence is a work of net.</p>
<p>And so it seems most peculiar<br>
that the network carried by light itself<br>
in numbers of precise googols<br>
should come to feed the voiceless thoughts<br>
which hammer relentlessly at the mind’s attendance<br>
for there is no dream without its sleeper.</p>
<h1 id="out-of-bounds">Out of Bounds</h1>
<p>When you know there is a spark<br>
And you know there is a duty—<br>
A collision happens short, in your mind<br>
Imagine: could we transcend the boundaries?</p>
<p>Because what else is there to life<br>
Than the faces you brush against the street<br>
To keep your soul’s teeth white<br>
Against all the infractions of memory</p>
<p>Everyone keeps to their path,<br>
The path they’ve kept no less than it’s kept them<br>
Wearily, reaping their souls’ time, only for another<br>
To ask the same question—to feel the same spark</p>
<h1 id="before-you-know">Before You Know</h1>
<p>Friends bask in the sunlight<br>
when distance gathers clouds<br>
the shades are displaced.</p>
<h1 id="we-can-fix-your-heart">We Can Fix Your Heart</h1>
<p>We can take out your heart<br>
and completely replace it with another’s<br>
but we cannot take your mind<br>
and replace it with another’s.</p>
<p>All the wonders of medicine<br>
discovering our body as mere gears<br>
to be oiled by drugs or outright supplanted<br>
and become unburdened by this vessel.</p>
<p>But we cannot split your soul in two<br>
sorting good from bad<br>
to switch out the worse with better<br>
and ease the weight you must bear.</p>
<p>Why can we not reach into you<br>
like we do with chemicals and surgery<br>
to repair what has been weakened and damaged<br>
and restore you to your freedom?</p>
<p>What does the mind have that the heart does not?<br>
What does the soul have that cannot be touched by drugs?<br>
What is your spirit made of such others cannot enliven you<br>
yet you must enliven yourself through their presence?</p>
<p>Is it history that sets them apart?<br>
But a heart has its own scars and tears<br>
that bear witness to times of intensity and strife<br>
or just the iteration of a slow development.</p>
<p>Is it thought that holds the difference?<br>
But thought cannot be anything else but that of mind<br>
for it is what mind is and does<br>
the being that feels its being.</p>
<p>Is it a quantum of dependency—<br>
that the mind depends on much more,<br>
but this would not explain, why<br>
it could not be broken down.</p>
<p>Is it freedom, then, that decides<br>
but a heart has some small measure of its own developing too<br>
yet it does not know it—ah,<br>
the consciousness that knows itself to be<br>
can never lose this certainty,<br>
tighter than a beat to its heart<br>
does the mind breathe with its thoughts<br>
as the soul gathers in the clearing of their horizon<br>
and the spirit that looks back to delight in their company<br>
recognizes its self-knowing spirits in their wool of history<br>
or, as they say,<br>
the cat is out of the bag.</p>
<p>We can take out your heart<br>
and completely replace it with another’s<br>
but we cannot take your mind<br>
and replace it with another’s.</p>
<h1 id="service-of-death">Service of Death</h1>
<p>Enter the service of death<br>
Whose harbingers echo in memory impersonal<br>
The gold authority of Milton’s and Shakespeare’s<br>
Whose letter thrusts like a lance from a foregone tourney<br>
Balks the absurdity of their existence—<br>
Which now, sweet effect, does beckon allure<br>
To the present feeling, that unkempt reservoir<br>
That bids the cup forgetfulness and unlearning<br>
Our most sacred gift</p>
<p>But through the old phalanx of these words<br>
A chance javelin is thrown at life’s charioteer most hasteful<br>
And breaks their delicate wheel, in which turn<br>
Tutelage is sworn at the falling upon the ground<br>
A pain that transcends all wind grazed joys:<br>
To learn to speak anew in their language<br>
And abide in foreign laws make their names sacred<br>
Molded is the soul now and forever<br>
To reanimate their world in yours</p>
<p>Through these once wordy manacles<br>
The brainy stem has grown many branches and leaves<br>
Where each enjoys a sunlight to the other’s surplus<br>
And communion gathers in corridors watery<br>
Time’s crusty experience, that physical reimbursement,<br>
Revealing finally the meaning of these old censors<br>
Whose regal speech sang neither of words nor names<br>
But reached only so far that your voice may have cause to sing;<br>
And intone to heart, beneath the mind’s politicking:<br>
That they have in all this time<br>
In your service been</p>
<h1 id="come-back-to-me">Come Back To Me</h1>
<p>A crawling specter rises<br>
moving constantly without going anywhere<br>
the house is empty, nobody is home<br>
a fallout enervating leeches the marrow of my mind<br>
and I cannot remember why.</p>
<p>Going from one alienating place to another<br>
wrecks mental decapitation upon the day<br>
before the survival instinct has had time to kick in<br>
I linger in this waiting room<br>
unable to pay a debt I have not accrued.</p>
<p>Why did you do it?<br>
Introspection asks, reclining on the couch<br>
Why was it done to me?<br>
I retort, shifting the scales<br>
What is desire for? Is the question.</p>
<p>Fiery, flesh wakens flesh<br>
only to bind the promethean giant<br>
where the beak of pity daily carves at mind’s body<br>
drawing directions to the future<br>
and nightly the past grows together.</p>
<p>I seek the spirit that is lost to me,<br>
but it is I who is lost to the spirit—<br>
I am he who has become dead,<br>
whose body life flees,<br>
and attracts dust and fleas—<br>
a hand enfolds within my own<br>
stirring impulse, circular reaction<br>
and I hear the whispers<br>
I always thought my own<br>
come back to me.</p>
<h1 id="to-still-survive">To Still Survive</h1>
<p>Wrapped in a coat of ice<br>
I pass through the doors of hell<br>
wearing a stone mask<br>
to shield my heart from mental storm.</p>
<p>All the senses to battle stations<br>
while the mind conjures tactics<br>
for only one destination can be computed<br>
as each moment requires is own design.</p>
<p>It is not until after that the cost is known<br>
and all the fatigue as avalanche buries<br>
with icy thorns enveloping the spirit<br>
and poisons the morrow through wanton vigilance.</p>
<p>When the light of my presence fails to reflect<br>
my world loses its color<br>
and I begin to believe<br>
that I will never be free.</p>
<p>But though this self-imposed frost comes harsh<br>
harsher is your silent spite and irradiating disdain<br>
and so I give you my coldest countenance<br>
in order to still survive.</p>
<h1 id="spites-unlife">Spite’s Unlife</h1>
<p>There is not a world I can escape to<br>
where I do not find your invidious presence<br>
whose proximity reverses all light<br>
and by vile suction begets freezing void.</p>
<p>And I harken to your oppressive fragrance<br>
by redoubling it with my own,<br>
to crush this crushing creature of preset time<br>
which rudely abducts eternity’s future moments.</p>
<p>My mind is a throne of blades<br>
melted together by hatred’s free fury<br>
that keeps molding and shaping<br>
every mental fiber to its doomed ire.</p>
<p>What delight to murder your image<br>
and crucify your spirit<br>
to turn that evil gaze upon itself<br>
and see your soul break behind those dewy eyes.</p>
<p>But the more I heap upon this raging pyre<br>
the further I deepen my own burn<br>
and tattoo into memory this superficial spite—<br>
becoming the very thing I despise.</p>
<p>Forgiveness’s sly falsetto beckons me to return<br>
to see the other as oneself, as all of God’s prideful creatures<br>
yet justice’s formal tenor calls to see it for what it is<br>
and squash this misdeed that restoration may commence.</p>
<p>Despite all, whether by justice or mercy<br>
this unlife persists and etches deeper into the bone<br>
when sometimes one must be prescient in holding on to one’s own hunger<br>
and let all this be<br>
the bad dream that it is.</p>
<h1 id="strange-power">Strange Power</h1>
<p>It is of a power strange<br>
To be beholden to re-imaginings<br>
Of matters long gone<br>
Like the slimy trails of a snail<br>
Patterns inchoate and no more</p>
<p>What does one look for<br>
In these scattered drawings<br>
That one does not see<br>
Presented in the present<br>
Ah, there is the rub - caught in the double</p>
<p>Either the present cannot contain it all<br>
Or you cannot imbibe all of what is given<br>
Either way, this giant now bleeds into past and present<br>
Forming wounds for the future<br>
And scars of the past</p>
<p>But the flesh does its work<br>
Best defined by the living organism<br>
That resolute brings together and stitches<br>
Good as well as bad<br>
That this individual may a history bear</p>
<h1 id="horizon-of-the-sea">Horizon of the Sea</h1>
<p>I love the ocean horizon not for its remoteness<br>
But for its nearness<br>
The line that stretches across from side to side<br>
Keeps each raw moment to the same as the last<br>
Affording easy entry, from left to right<br>
And right to left</p>
<p>Unlike everything else in nature,<br>
The ocean horizon mimics our own mathematical nature<br>
The line that keeps steady when all else toils,<br>
Rolls and recoils, spends its time thriftily avoiding its shatter-some feast<br>
While the horizon stays fast,<br>
In dividing simply</p>
<p>Unseen to the naked I does nature<br>
From nature recharge the return of its leap<br>
As the sea below and the sky above each are<br>
At home in this mutual separation<br>
As a judgment splintered comes back to its judger<br>
Their sundered whole</p>
<h1 id="purgation-on-the-mount">Purgation on the Mount</h1>
<p>When we find ourselves<br>
On the shore of a vast endless past<br>
Where the horizon calls for an infinite scroll<br>
Buried in the seams that mind,<br>
Then does the expanse’s shine convey<br>
The mountain that stood waiting in life’s reflection<br>
To welcome your step<br>
To bid you begin</p>
<p>Its majesty is daunting<br>
And where beauty is inspired<br>
A bond soon weaves as tight as fate<br>
But the mountain opens these as your friends;<br>
Where its rugged skin reveals gentle paths<br>
Elevation is curbed to a rising shoulder<br>
And to those athirst it grants from its veins<br>
Bittersweet waters flowing freely</p>
<p>Each step invites another<br>
As easy as the wind grazes the ground<br>
But ten become hundred and soon a thousand<br>
And endurance begins its trying song,<br>
Yet sweetly counterpoints the voice to stop<br>
Soothing are its images that cease the ache<br>
To bring that energetic turbulence<br>
To a premature end</p>
<p>But a deeper promise resonates further still<br>
The compact made with the mount<br>
Signed by beauty terrestrial born<br>
And witnessed by celestial mind;<br>
Resolve shakes the limbs to steel their footing<br>
And heart is taken to transport impulse<br>
From heavenly industry<br>
Into earthly art</p>
<p>Fragile is this manner of perseverance<br>
That is fed solely by such sky-trod will<br>
But its glad punctuation arrives in the will of the body<br>
That unshakably grows trees of memories etched in movement,<br>
Here a true third voice sings<br>
Born by toil but found in beauty<br>
And bears witness to its own epiphany<br>
Sunlit in the arc of the valley below</p>
<p>As little as there is left to go<br>
It could have been thrice the climb<br>
As limbs now sing in rhythmic absolution<br>
And courage impervious is dulled only by cold rest,<br>
But zenith propounds no other purpose<br>
For here a pool of water crystal clear coalesced<br>
Baptizes the spirit in Eden’s finest garments<br>
Dousing enflamed desire in sweetest satisfaction</p>
<p>Now your beginning has made its end<br>
As the mountain throne yielded all its treasure<br>
That sorely was fought under gravity’s pressure<br>
Forging your all- confounding and conflicting voices<br>
Into a single soul blade cut from the body’s hammer<br>
Ensconcing hearth in motility’s furnace<br>
To bring home into the eye’s view<br>
From every peak</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Time across distance peels our myriad souls<br>
To their innermost soul<br>
Waiting all this time to be known<br>
To let who you are become -</p>
<h1 id="desync">Desync</h1>
<p>The time we once had<br>
becomes a timestamp for the rest of our lives,<br>
for each year that comes around<br>
and every birthday we celebrate<br>
we remain connected though we are not,<br>
but by some hidden law of existence<br>
we march lockstep with time<br>
and decay together.</p>
<p>This mark is matched in depth<br>
only by its intensity,<br>
and like ramessessian reliefs<br>
they are not easily carved over<br>
and come to stand most out<br>
when truth’s sun blazes freely.</p>
<p>And though I draw secret delight<br>
in reminiscing these etchings upon my bones,<br>
this screen betrays against my outer desire—<br>
and against its deigned purpose—<br>
how my heart has been<br>
frozen stuck in a loop<br>
and how with all the play that our time represented<br>
I am out of sync.</p>
<h1 id="to-hit-the-mark">To Hit the Mark</h1>
<p>A lifetime can pass<br>
without the knowledge<br>
to hit the mark<br>
much less know that it is there.</p>
<p>If life is a game of snooker,<br>
then which player has hid our color<br>
and do our strikes count for more<br>
than the fouls of our opponent?</p>
<p>How many attempts does it take?<br>
How many attempts can one afford?<br>
How far must one be cast adrift<br>
when shooting past the target?</p>
<p>But does it matter how far beyond<br>
one falls<br>
when all it takes is to lift oneself<br>
and turn<br>
and put in another throw.</p>
<p>If the mark moves, it can be shot at<br>
from any side<br>
and if it stays still<br>
you have all the advantage.</p>
<p>Sin can remain that which<br>
is at the end of our distance to God<br>
or it can be the distance whose cross<br>
animates our deepest promise.</p>
<h1 id="old-dogs">Old Dogs</h1>
<p>For as long worth remembering<br>
these old mutts have followed me around.<br>
Once we were all young<br>
and the future seemed eternal.</p>
<p>Now our lifestyles have conquered us<br>
and the past grows overbearing.
And while we each have our space<br>
visitations are not infrequent.</p>
<p>They come to me,<br>
rugged fur, some halting,<br>
all slow, missing a tooth or two,<br>
for the comfort afforded to creatures.</p>
<p>For creators cannot lay claim to the same rest<br>
for they are instead tormented by the desire for motion<br>
and they will never cease to make<br>
their home by your side.</p>
<h1 id="fahmida">Fahmida</h1>
<p>Fahmida bears little greeting<br>
as she opens the door ajar,<br>
while her eyes remain downcast<br>
whether out of will or habit<br>
she refuses to meet mine.</p>
<p>But an instant is all my heart needed<br>
when sight devoured recklessly<br>
to behold her beatific countenance<br>
with the feeling of iambic justice<br>
whose terror brought me to this threshold.</p>
<p>She asks me to be made clean<br>
to which I acquiesce without reserve<br>
in the softest tone I could muster<br>
for when I step aside to next chamber<br>
my soul is already awash with tremor.</p>
<p>She lies in nature’s garment upon my return<br>
and makes neither gesture nor speech<br>
but reclines in the naked truth<br>
of certainty’s comfort<br>
and awaits meekly for those athirst.</p>
<p>No blemish or mark caresses her skin<br>
her form only holds the fullness of hours<br>
and all is granted to those who require<br>
to find fiery respite in an ancient song<br>
and remember one’s story in the eternal midnight sky.</p>
<p>As particles falling to make an aurora<br>
so imagination was enflamed<br>
an electric curtain that swept across the body of her idea<br>
for my thoughts firmly held her out of maniacal genius<br>
as she conjured day out of the world’s night.</p>
<p>There is no sin in a world of love<br>
but that world is not here<br>
the world of measure and law rule our souls<br>
and while their diligence mean well from eternity’s city<br>
no prayer can steal into time’s garden without noise,<br>
but an angel fell, not for our sins, but for our hearts<br>
and remains disguised in the corners of our eyes<br>
rising only when reason’s cunning<br>
through rhythmic absolution<br>
exposes wisdom’s laughter.</p>
<h1 id="the-alchemists">The Alchemists</h1>
<p>The alchemist of old sought neither treasure nor glory<br>
But the power to make these by command,<br>
To discover the sacred formulation that could transmute<br>
The base and worthless into the most valued high</p>
<p>The new alchemists fervently seek treasure and glory<br>
But of the heart and of emotion<br>
To turn their minds into the alembic<br>
Powered by the fire of their soul</p>
<p>Both sought the same through different means<br>
Yet the means are merely that of outside and inside<br>
And so their distinction betrays a superficiality<br>
At the core of the human being<br>
Whose insides are outside<br>
And outsides inside.</p>
<p>O’ many faced one, you whose countenance<br>
No amount of masks can cover quickly enough<br>
You dance through time with a hidden grace<br>
Visible only to those who have survived</p>
<p>What are these many faces of your essence<br>
Reflected as true distinctions in the taste of their existence,<br>
That proceed forward to ground the weight of your conscious self<br>
As it touches the reality of its being<br>
To make its eternal wake</p>
<p>Evert category I dare imagine<br>
Instantly falls short of your present potency—<br>
The mind leaps beyond the speed of light—<br>
And here falls that remainder that is me</p>
<p>Vessels embodied shed their tranquility for time’s vampirism<br>
That a future may have a past, and a past a future<br>
These dimensions are the permanent recoil<br>
Of souls enclosed in branches of congealed conceptions<br>
Ripe plucked as rhythmic fruit whose sight<br>
Gifts the taste of desire</p>
<p>First is the immediacy of contact<br>
Through sensuousness delightful<br>
It enabled in the purity of force<br>
The original language of being<br>
That spoke of exertion and resistance<br>
And of fatigue and overcoming<br>
Of sumptuous energy and pushed power<br>
And taught this verdant reality to precede all else<br>
For the creature arrives bodied<br>
And learns first the economy of these</p>
<p>Second is the mediation of distance<br>
Through mental retreat bewildering<br>
It activates the universal tethering that binds<br>
All existence to a meditation on what was<br>
A freezing logos appears beneath appearances<br>
And throws to vanity all the sanctity of duty and courage<br>
For here a reflected reality precedes every other<br>
As the creature rises to godhood<br>
And learns of its absolute powerlessness</p>
<p>Is it loss of the first or the gain of the second<br>
That brings the creature most sadness and disdain?<br>
Perhaps a loss is a gain and a gain a loss<br>
And through both there is a deeper gain<br>
And a further loss—<br>
And how has this grown together thread<br>
Not continued to weave<br>
This tapestry of life<br>
Whose watchword rings: continue?</p>
<p>Weighted by nothingness<br>
And carried by being<br>
The creature walks through two dimensions<br>
Whose exposure is a moment and a breath<br>
And the thread is asked to grow a great blanket of memory<br>
To prepare for the coming of death’s winter<br>
Whose length knows no end<br>
In depths without recall.</p>
<p>Desire and death, companions of history<br>
As they quest through the human heart<br>
To unveil the marionettes puppeteered by their former selves<br>
In chambers where no thought has traversed<br>
For it arrives either too early or too late<br>
And skips that most necessary beat<br>
Where all the pieces fall together.</p>
<p>Is the human one or are they many?<br>
Is this a question of time or of place?<br>
A question of duration or context,<br>
Of endurance or tranquility?<br>
But leap by mental vertigo to think horizons vertically,<br>
And see each share a simple difference:<br>
From beginnings and endings,<br>
Through perennial flow immobile circuit<br>
To what takes or what provides -</p>
<h1 id="water-life">Water, Life</h1>
<p>Before you quenched my thirst<br>
with your lips<br>
and washed my face<br>
in your words,<br>
was life only the thing that survived<br>
but was not lived for,<br>
and while much was written<br>
little was said.</p>
<p>When your eyes looked into mine,<br>
and mine into yours,<br>
did the double doors of the horizon unlock<br>
and push aside the dusty scaffold<br>
through a wind so great<br>
that it held me in your embrace<br>
where time was lured into eternity<br>
and everything dissipated but your mind.</p>
<p>The water you give<br>
contains more mystery than ancient scrolls<br>
for all the worship of the sun<br>
cannot but echo the light of your touch,<br>
for wherever you grace my skin with yours<br>
feelings from life’s first awakening<br>
become summoned through me<br>
at your sweet call.</p>
<h1 id="elysium">Elysium</h1>
<p>Some things are meant to be easy<br>
some things are supposed to just happen<br>
some things need you to let go.</p>
<p>Whether it is about taking charge<br>
or being the enjoyment of another’s<br>
you live the decision they made.</p>
<p>Neither ought nor need<br>
are adequate to this<br>
that simply is.</p>
<h1 id="there-is-a-depth-within-me">There Is A Depth Within Me</h1>
<p>There is a depth within me<br>
I can never rewrite<br>
Just as stars in the night-sky<br>
I will never reach</p>
<p>And yet their light reaches me<br>
All the same<br>
And remain faithful<br>
Revealed by the cover of darkness</p>
<p>But it is the sea, the forests<br>
And mountains<br>
That stay silent in this darkly display<br>
When all else appear to flicker<br>
And punctuate with glimmering delight</p>
<p>The windows of these huddled hearths<br>
Like barnacles upon a Leviathan<br>
Build their history steadfast on time’s sandy beach<br>
Saved at each moment by mores unfathomable<br>
As fragile as a melody’s path, their sense is but<br>
A whisper through the doors of perception</p>
<p>But empty are these words<br>
For they are mere echoes<br>
Chanting but a forgetfulness of life—<br>
Just as that light that travels from these stars<br>
Whose source has long vanished</p>
<p>But not this moon<br>
Who is our reminder<br>
That day is but a day’s night away</p>
<h1 id="between-lost-and-found">Between Lost and Found</h1>
<p>I don’t know when it first began<br>
but I have been coming here to this place<br>
in search for tranquility and peace<br>
amidst homely surroundings.</p>
<p>A cabin in the woods,<br>
a trail through the fields,<br>
a flower atop the mountain,<br>
a mirror in the river.</p>
<p>Furniture built from self-borne planks<br>
keep my scavenged books in tidy memorabilia,<br>
and on the table sit a pair of aviators<br>
bearing witness to someone’s character.</p>
<p>I return here to find<br>
what I didn’t know was missing<br>
and by the time I leave<br>
it is lost to me what I always wanted.</p>
<p>But while here, my mind is set to play<br>
to read frivolously of lost worlds<br>
go batting of embodied visions<br>
and see them hurled across the splintered horizon.</p>
<p>Here is my zone<br>
my innermost desires are fulfilled<br>
nowhere else I want to be<br>
lest they bring me closer to reality.</p>
<p>A world is a sly conditional<br>
and secretly a perennial draft,<br>
breech but one border<br>
and this plainsong shatters.</p>
<p>Whether by accident or design<br>
once the limit is observed, the shell has cracked<br>
and the old rushes in to fill the new<br>
unless truth arrives face to face.</p>
<p>Across the edges of my world I saw him<br>
who was in my likeness exact<br>
and pursued the things I would pursue<br>
but he is wrong and must be stopped.</p>
<p>Intercepting his course, I threw the first punch<br>
and brought war between his world and mine<br>
even though mine was mangled<br>
and held his in context.</p>
<p>Conflict stems from two zones<br>
competing to be the world<br>
each fighting for their idea’s survival<br>
unwilling to become a moment of another.</p>
<p>But why should one world willingly submit<br>
to be a zone of another’s, a mere view<br>
when a world is made unbounded by truth<br>
how then can certainty bind it?</p>
<p>He had his paraphernalia like my own<br>
and no doubt had visions that stemmed from the same hunger<br>
but he had not found what I had lost<br>
for it was my loss that led to finding him.</p>
<p>Yet had I found or been found,<br>
and if found, who would find me?<br>
Did I lose or was I lost,<br>
if lost, what could lose me?</p>
<p>Is conflict the crucible of this being’s memory<br>
whose nether tendrils strive to bring to actuality<br>
such that it may rehearse its own gesture<br>
and behold in our furrowed faces its own.</p>
<p>In the struggle I defeat him,<br>
or he defeats me,<br>
he is part of my world or I am part of his,<br>
either way, each of our own worlds are null—<br>
for the world we share binds us to its truth<br>
and the task becomes not to push one’s view<br>
but to integrate that of another<br>
just as you are joined to the world that is thought.</p>
<h1 id="cato-the-elder">Cato the Elder</h1>
<p>A new man emerges<br>
forged from his love of virtue<br>
and duty to his country<br>
he lives with unyielding discipline.</p>
<p>Battling on the field as well as in courts<br>
be it with words or swords,<br>
against foreigners or countrymen<br>
none are spared his righteous vigil.</p>
<p>Choosing his companion not out of desire or wealth<br>
but for the alignment of noble values,<br>
and upon this soil grew an unfaltering love<br>
whose fruit was a son.</p>
<p>Deemed too important to be left to expert slaves<br>
he educated him after his own mold<br>
yet adjusted to the boy’s weaknesses and strength<br>
and saw him grow to an accomplished citizen.</p>
<p>For who was this person<br>
who could dedicate himself to virtue so,<br>
without ever asking<br>
what is it was?</p>
<p>What were you really loyal to, Cato<br>
was it virtue or the beauty of its idea?<br>
Or was it the importance it bestowed upon you<br>
for pride never seemed to stand in the way of your virtue.</p>
<p>Where does virtue cease and oppression begin?<br>
And where does efficiency end and virtue continue?<br>
When, if ever, does virtue allow for vice?
Unless it always contains it too some degree.</p>
<p>Why could you be compelled by virtue where others failed?<br>
Why, if virtue makes one virtuous, would anyone fail to choose it?<br>
For was there ever a creature that did not pursue the good<br>
to the very best of its ability, always?</p>
<p>Or does light cast on the virtuous garment<br>
reveal its own shadowy patches<br>
in threads of pettiness and scorn<br>
whose pestilence turns virtue’s service from the good to the self.</p>
<p>Yet how can virtue shine so strongly without its knowledge<br>
for without reason it amounts at best to stoicism,<br>
yet you are somehow better than this –<br>
and worse;<br>
for you always put your mind to action<br>
yet let that action remain without thought<br>
and so you reach the apex of conscience<br>
but slip so easily into the nadir of morality;<br>
and obtusely refusing to know this,<br>
you persist gleefully in the pendulum<br>
but this last commitment to stale betterment<br>
tips the scales towards tragedy.</p>
<p>To feel better or bettering one’s feeling.
Can you tell the difference?
Can you live the difference?</p>
<h1 id="the-ocean-mirror">The Ocean Mirror</h1>
<p>As heavy as the seas are<br>
With their swirling depths<br>
And twisted currents<br>
There is always a lightness on the surface<br>
That can be cupped by a child’s hand</p>
<p>Malleable from top to bottom<br>
Like a range of cells<br>
Where each atop the other<br>
Carries their weight as the body swirls</p>
<h1 id="life-a-story">Life, A Story</h1>
<p>A life is a span of a story<br>
A story a beginning, middle and end<br>
Each part has its start<br>
And its end, which makes it like a story</p>
<p>And so a story are stories of stories<br>
As life is a life of lives<br>
Each with a beginning, middle and end<br>
Weaved through itself with no end</p>
<h1 id="i-know-i-have-to-move-on-but">I know I have to move on, but</h1>
<p>I know I have to move on, but<br>
the smile on your face returns joy<br>
from every corner of the world<br>
and I know that you smile for me no longer.</p>
<p>I know I have to move on, but<br>
the goofiness of your ways makes my heart jump<br>
beyond the clouds of metaphysics<br>
but I know you do not become a clown for me.</p>
<p>I know I have to move on, I really do, but<br>
the shine of your beauty and your artful eye<br>
invite only divine appropriations<br>
and I know that I am so very mortal.</p>
<p>I know I have to move on, but<br>
the music of your memory brings my mind<br>
to dance as if life was only beginning<br>
but I know that I am only closer to the end.</p>   </div> </div> </div>  </div> </div>  </div> <div class="relative"> <div class="z-30 absolute bottom-0 left-[50%] transform -translate-x-1/2 translate-y-1/2"> <div class="glass rounded-lg p-2"> <p class="text-xs">© Filip Niklas 2024.
